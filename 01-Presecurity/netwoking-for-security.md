# Networking for Security

## What it is ?
Networking is how computers communicate with each other using IP addresses, ports, and protocols. 
Every action on the internet, including attacks and defenses, depends on network communication.

## Why attackers care ?
Attackers rely on networking knowledge to discover targets. 
By scanning IP addresses and open ports, they identify running services that may be misconfigured or vulnerable.
Poorly secured network services are often the first entry point in an attack.

## Why defenders care ?
Defenders monitor network traffic to detect suspicious behavior such as unexpected connections, unusual port usage, or repeated scanning attempts.
Securing networks by closing unused ports and filtering traffic reduces the attack surface.

## Key networking components from a security perspective

### IP Address
An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.
Attackers use IP addresses to locate targets, while defenders use them to trace malicious activity.

### Ports
Ports represent services running on a system.
Open ports expose services, and unnecessary open ports increase the attack surface.

### Protocols
Protocols define rules for communication.
Some protocols (like HTTP or FTP) transmit data insecurely if not properly protected.

## Common security risks related to networking
- Open and unused ports
- Insecure protocols
- Lack of traffic monitoring
- Misconfigured firewalls

## Key takeaways
- Networking is the foundation of all cyber attacks and defenses
- Open ports directly increase attack surface
- Understanding traffic flow helps in both attacking and defending systems
